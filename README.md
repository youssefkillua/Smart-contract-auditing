# Smart-contract-auditing
In this article, we will walk through the process of performing a smart contract audit, which entails a combination
of multiple methodologies applied to the project together with specification and documentation. Many analyses are
performed automatically using tools, while others require human intervention.


Audit is the practice of evaluating systems, apps, smart contracts, and dApps from the standpoint of an
unprivileged or anonymous user "hacker" to determine legal and contractual ramifications, improve security,
decrease attack surface and mitigate risk.


The audit scope can on-chain smart contract code and sometimes includes off-chain components that interact with
the smart contracts.
